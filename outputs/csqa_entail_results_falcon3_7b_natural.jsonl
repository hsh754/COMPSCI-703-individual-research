Among the given choices, the most promising option is \"bank.\" This is because banks require strong security measures to protect valuable assets and sensitive information. Additionally, a revolving door allows for multiple people to enter or exit simultaneously, which is convenient for busy banking hours.\n\nTwo specific reasons support this choice:\n1. Banks need robust security to safeguard cash and customer data. A revolving door serves as an effective barrier against unauthorized access.\n2. The convenience of a revolving door in handling large volumes of customers entering or leaving quickly aligns well with the operational needs of a bank.\n\nThe option \"library\" is unsuitable because, while libraries do require security, they are generally less concerned with rapid throughput and more focused on protecting physical collections and patron privacy.
